In terms of business and holidays, Turkey is the one of the visited country in the world. Turkey hosts a lot of tourists and do the honours for business
events four seasons. In addition to this, as Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir are metropolis cities they're the most demanded cities by foreigners. This website 
created for everyone who has a plan to visit these 3 cities and providing all specialties explicitly. You can find brief history of Turkey and 3 cities, videos to display the most common and 
touristic locaitons, top three recommended places to see by me and contact page to provide costumer quailty service on time.

## UX

 As is known to all, making a vacation plan is a hard period for everyone. This website aim to provide brief and clear information 
 to users and guide them to make it properly. People of all ages visits Turkey every year. For this reason I created to website user-friendly, didn't make it complicated
 and all links are in sight and accessible. Firstly users get brief information from our main page about Turkey. Later on they gather details from Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir pages whcih provide videos, recommended events and more information.
 Lastly, in case of they decide to make a vacation plan in Turkey, users get in touch with us on contact page. They can get more details about us from social links below the page.
